Here's a breakdown of what each folder contains:

## images: 
 - This folder contains all your images used for training and validation. 
  - Each image should be in a supported format like JPEG, PNG, etc.

## labels: 
 - This folder contains label files for each corresponding image. 
 - Each label file should have the same name as its corresponding image file but with a .txt extension. 
 - The label file format depends on the specific YOLO implementation you're using. 
 - For YOLOv5, each line in the label file should represent one object instance in the image, with the following format:
  <class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
